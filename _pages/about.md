Hi, my name is Prajakta Ghumatkar. I am a data analytics enthusiast pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science from Northeastern University. With a strong passion for utilizing data to drive business solutions and improve decision-making, I am eager to jumpstart my career in the field of data science.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, which provided me with a solid foundation in programming and database management. During my studies, I developed a deep interest in data analysis and visualization, leading me to specialize in data science.

In my Master's program, I have honed my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. I have worked on various projects, including but not limited to recommendation systems  and predictive models to analyze consumer behavior. My academic experiences have further solidified my belief in the power of data to solve real-world problems.

Although I do not have any prior work experience in the industry, I am a quick learner and have a strong desire to contribute to organizations using my skills and knowledge. I am confident that my educational background and passion for data analytics will make me a valuable asset to any team.

In my free time, I enjoy a variety of interests including reading in libraries, writing poetry, and caf√© hopping. I love immersing myself in books and find that reading expands my knowledge and provides a much-needed escape. Poetry writing allows me to express my thoughts and emotions through words, while cafe hopping gives me the chance to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee while reflecting or reading. These activities balance my passion for knowledge and creativity with a much-needed break from the fast-paced world of data science.

I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and be a part of a dynamic and innovative team that values data-driven decision making.
