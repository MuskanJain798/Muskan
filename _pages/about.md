Hey there!


I'm Muskan, a dedicated and results-driven data scientist with a passion for leveraging data analytics to derive meaningful insights and drive decision-making. My expertise lies in developing end-to-end data solutions and applying advanced analytics techniques to solve complex problems. With a strong background in computer science and hands-on experience in various programming languages and tools, I am equipped to tackle data challenges and deliver impactful results.

<strong>EDUCATION:</strong>

I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from The Ohio State University, where I focused on expanding my knowledge in data science and honing my analytical skills. During my studies, I maintained a GPA of 3.7/4, demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence. Prior to my master's degree, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunications from Pune Institute of Computer Technology in India, achieving a CGPA of 9.1/10.

<strong>WORK EXPERIENCE:</strong>

In my current role as a Graduate Research Associate at the Department of Emergency Medicine - Wexner Medical Center, I have successfully led the development and implementation of an end-to-end pipeline for the 911-AI-PREDICT research project. I engineered a reliable pipeline that transformed over 10,000 raw 911 audio calls into organized transcripts, reducing transcription time by 50%. Additionally, I designed and implemented a code solution for efficient extraction of addresses from complex data. I utilized SQL techniques and data analysis tools to derive valuable insights for decision-making purposes.

During my tenure as Event Head at the IEEE Technical Event - RoboLIGA, I supervised and mentored a team of 10 junior members, ensuring the successful execution of tasks. I spearheaded the creation of an innovative online scoring application that revolutionized the tracking system, resulting in increased event engagement.

<strong>ACADEMIC PROJECTS:</strong>

In my academic projects, I developed an integrated data analysis framework for complex high-dimensional data and contributed to enhancing database performance and data-driven decision-making. I also developed a real-time interactive dashboard using D3.js, HTML, and CSS to enhance situational awareness through crowdsourcing earthquake crisis reports.

I possess strong analytical skills, proficiency in programming languages such as Python, SQL, MATLAB, Java, and HTML, and experience with tools and libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I am a strong communicator, able to effectively convey technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


I'm excited to contribute my expertise to challenging projects and make a positive impact as a data scientist. Let's connect and discuss how I can add value to your team or organization.
